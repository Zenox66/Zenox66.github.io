            <h2>
                Brief Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Jokes aside, I am <em>Mark Stephen SJ Reyno</em> and my hobbies are drawing, writing, gaming, and
                animating. I’m an introvert yet I always talk to someone who are dearly close to
                me. I would be optimistic as far as possible so I would always try to stay happy. I
                don’t usually like to be the center of the attention or to be on the stage since I
                would have a burst of anxiety.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Why did you enroll as an <dfn title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</dfn> student? Why not the other track or strands?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I enrolled as an <dfn title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</dfn> student because I have to chase my dream job. I would
choose Arts and Design track but I can’t be a <em>solo game developer</em> if I don’t even
know things about programming. I also have a burst of excitement whenever I
see any programming languages like C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, and many
other involved. Surely, I can learn arts by self-teaching and I always draw ever since I
was a child.
            </p>

            <h2>
                What is your dream job? How do you think will this course will help you in
                pursuing your career?
            </h2>
            <p>
                My dream job is to be a <em>game developer</em> whether solo or not, I am sure that is
that my passion is telling me. I’m sure learning more about programming would
help me achieve my future career. I would be obligated to learn different coding
languages and its uses. I did said that I do enjoy seeing programming languages
involved.

            <h2>
                To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing course? Yourself, family,
friends, special someone etc. why?
            </h2>
            <p>
                For everyone, it’s because I wanted to make games with exciting stories, a fun
game mechanics, and a beautiful design. I would be giving out meaningful
stories where people would enjoy and may have help with their lives. I would be
supporting my family since the game developing have high amount of profit. My
friends would be having fun over the games I give and probably make a fan
contents about it. Lastly, the games I made are also for myself since I do enjoy
playing videogames and such.
